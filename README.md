# Exploring Neo-Riemannian Transformations in Music Production Contexts
This repository contains links to audo and video examples to support my chapter titled _Exploring Neo-Riemannian Transformations in Music Production Contexts_. The chapter was published as part of the book 'Neo-Riemannian Analysis' edited by Bozhidar Chapkanov and published by Vernon Press.

# Abstract
_This chapter explores the application of neo-Riemannian transformations (NRT) within a number of music production contexts. The first setting is commonly referred to as song starters, which are initially sketched ideas. Song starters are applicable across the field of music production, useful equally as much for electronic music producers as for singer-songwriters and bands. The second context considers NRT's within a more traditional MIDI situation, either using a keyboard or controller interface, or by hand entering notes in a MIDI editor. The third approach explores more labor intensive production work using automation to realise transformations. Examples include treating the oscillators of a synthesizer plugin, such as Native Instruments Massive, as three independent voices. The fourth example is specific to Ableton Live and uses Follow Actions. These are a type of branching logic invoked when a midi pattern concludes playing. Examples of instructional commands include stop, again (repeat), first, last and jump._

_Most popular music styles tend to utilise short harmonic sequences, generally using triads, using mechanisms Tagg refers to as chord shuttles and chord loops (Tagg 2009: 280–81). Commencing this examination using more familiar triadic chord progressions, the aim here is to inspire producers to relate their tonal preferences within NRT. Then to explore how to extend tonal approaches using NRT in familiar popular music production styles such as House, Trance, or Drum and Bass, for example. Particular attention will be placed to solving issues of bass (roots), an important aspect for many music productions, given the inverted nature of NRT, which is especially problematised when using samples. A question that this chapter seeks to explore is whether the production paradigm can be extended by the use of NRT – ideally applied not too restrictively – whilst keeping in mind that producers are more attracted by sound as a primary goal rather than fulfilling expectations of a functional/non-functional harmony. So, any NRT, single or compound, when combined with instrument texture(s) i.e. plugins, might be sufficient to achieve an interesting and engaging song or soundscape context for production work._
