This repository contains links to audo and video examples to support my chapter titled Exploring Neo-Riemannian Transformations in Music Production Contexts. The chapter was publoshed as part of the book 'Neo-Riemannian Analysis' edited by Bozhidar Chapkanov and published by Vernon Press.

The video examples illustrate the four production contexts discussed in the chapter.
